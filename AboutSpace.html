            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-2">The Sun</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-700">The Sun is the star at the center of our solar system, around which all the planets, asteroids, and other celestial bodies revolve. It is a massive ball of hot plasma, with internal convective motion that generates a powerful magnetic field. <br> <br>

                The Sun's diameter is about 109 times that of the Earth, making it by far the largest object in our solar system. It contains about 99.86% of the total mass of the solar system, with the remaining 0.14% being accounted for by all the planets, moons, asteroids, and other objects. <br><br>
                
                The Sun is responsible for providing the Earth with the energy that drives our climate and sustains life on our planet. It emits vast amounts of energy in the form of light and heat, which is absorbed by the Earth's atmosphere and used to power the processes of photosynthesis, which produces the oxygen and organic matter that are essential for life.  <br><br>
                
                The Sun has a complex magnetic field, which produces a range of phenomena, including sunspots, solar flares, and coronal mass ejections. These phenomena can have a significant impact on the Earth's climate, as well as on our communications systems and other technological infrastructure. <br><br>
                
                The Sun is estimated to be about 4.6 billion years old, and is expected to continue to shine for another 5 billion years or so, until it exhausts its nuclear fuel and eventually becomes a red giant star. <br> <br>
                The Sun is primarily composed of hydrogen (about 73% of its mass) and helium (about 25% of its mass), with trace amounts of other elements such as oxygen, carbon, neon, and iron. The Sun's interior is a hot, dense region where nuclear fusion reactions take place, fusing hydrogen atoms into helium and releasing vast amounts of energy in the form of light and heat. This energy is then radiated out from the Sun's surface into space, providing the Earth with the energy it needs to sustain life. The Sun's atmosphere is composed of several layers, including the photosphere, chromosphere, and corona, each with its own unique properties and characteristics.

            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-2">Mercury</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-700">Mercury is the smallest planet in our solar system and is the closest planet to the Sun. It is named after the Roman messenger god, Mercury, who is known for his speed. Due to its proximity to the Sun, Mercury has the shortest orbital period of any planet in the solar system, completing a full orbit in just 88 Earth days. <br> <br> 

                Mercury is a rocky planet with a heavily cratered surface, similar to the Earth's Moon. It has a very thin atmosphere, which means that there is no weather to speak of on the planet. Mercury's surface is also covered in a layer of fine dust, which is thought to have been formed by the impact of micrometeoroids. <br> <br>
                
                Due to its proximity to the Sun, Mercury is subject to extreme temperature variations. During the day, temperatures can soar up to 800 degrees Fahrenheit, while at night they can plummet to -290 degrees Fahrenheit. The planet's surface is also constantly bombarded by the solar wind, which is a stream of charged particles that is constantly flowing out from the Sun. <br> <br> 
                
                Mercury has been visited by only one spacecraft so far, NASA's Mariner 10, which flew past the planet three times in the mid-1970s. In 2008, NASA's Messenger spacecraft began orbiting Mercury, allowing scientists to study the planet in much greater detail. These missions have revealed that Mercury has a large iron core, which makes up about 85% of the planet's radius. <br> <br>
                Mercury is a rocky planet, and its composition is similar to that of Earth's Moon. It is primarily composed of silicate rock, with a large metallic core. The planet's core makes up about 85% of its radius and is made mostly of iron, with smaller amounts of nickel and other metals. The rest of the planet is made up of a rocky mantle and a thin crust, which is heavily cratered due to its long history of bombardment by asteroids and comets.
